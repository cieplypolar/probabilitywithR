Malignant Glioma Pilot Study

Description

A non-randomized pilot study on malignant glioma patients with pretargeted adjuvant radioimmunotherapy using yttrium-90-biotin.

Usage

glioma
Format

A data frame with 37 observations on 7 variables.

no.
patient number.

age
patient age (years).

sex
a factor with levels "F" (Female) and "M" (Male).

histology
a factor with levels "GBM" (grade IV) and "Grade3" (grade III).

group
a factor with levels "Control" and "RIT".

event
status indicator for time: FALSE for censored observations and TRUE otherwise.

time
survival time (months).

Details

The primary endpoint of this small pilot study is survival. Since the survival times are tied, 
the classical asymptotic logrank test may be inadequate in this setup. Therefore, a permutation test 
using Monte Carlo resampling was computed in the original paper. 
The data are taken from Tables 1 and 2 of Grana et al. (2002).
